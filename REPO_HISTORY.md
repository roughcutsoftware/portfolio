# Repository History

## Original Repository Creation Prompt

This document preserves the original prompt that was used to create this portfolio repository.

### Initial Requirements (PR #1)

**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Context:** Initial repository setup

> This is a portfolio repo that will house multiple 'learning' and 'how-to' visual studio ide projects, initial repo reqs:
> - working w-multiple repos within a top-level repo, not necessarily a 'mono-repo', but using sub-modules
> - advance git concepts, along with git-cmd examples
> - useful starter and conceptual projects

### Key Implementation Points

Based on the original prompt, the following were established:

1. **Git Submodules Architecture**: Structure to house multiple independent Visual Studio IDE projects within a top-level repository
2. **Advanced Git Concepts**: Comprehensive documentation covering advanced Git workflows and command examples
3. **Project Categories**:
   - Learning projects: Educational tutorials and step-by-step guides
   - Starter projects: Ready-to-use project templates and boilerplates
   - Conceptual projects: Design patterns and concept demonstrations

### Subsequent Developments

#### PR #2: Visual Studio IDE Setup
**Original Prompt:** "first task is to initial repo on local workstation within visual studio ide (vs)."

Added Visual Studio 2022 solution structure with .NET 9.0 console application for local development.

#### PR #3: Documentation Request
**Original Prompt:** "pls show me my original repo create prompt"

Created this document to preserve and make accessible the original repository creation prompt and development history.

## Purpose

This document serves as a historical record to:
- Preserve the original vision and requirements
- Provide context for future development decisions
- Help new contributors understand the repository's foundation
- Document the evolution of the project over time
