# Portfolio

This is a portfolio repo that will house multiple 'learning' and 'how-to' Visual Studio IDE projects.

## What is MDE?

**MDE** stands for **Medical Disability Examination**. It is a process used by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to assess the medical condition of veterans claiming disabilities related to their military service. Loyal Source Government Services has been awarded a contract by the VA to provide MDEs, which are essential for determining the level of disability and related compensation for veterans.

## Initial Repo Requirements

- Working with multiple repos within a top-level repo, not necessarily a 'mono-repo', but using submodules
- Advanced Git concepts, along with git command examples
- Useful starter and conceptual projects

## Projects Included

- **Learn.MDE.MVC.Dtos**: Shared DTOs for learning and demo purposes
- **Learn.MDE.MVC.Api**: Example .NET 7 Web API project
- **Learn.MDE.MVC.Web**: Razor Pages web project for hands-on learning

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/roughcutsoftware/portfolio.git
   ```

2. Initialize and update submodules (if any):

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022 or later.

## Git Concepts

- Branching, rebasing, submodules, cherry-pick, stash, and more
- See `/docs` or project markdown files for hands-on examples

## Notes

- This workspace is intended for experimentation, learning, and interview preparation.
- Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
