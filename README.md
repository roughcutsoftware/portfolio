# Portfolio - Learning & How-To Projects Repository

Welcome to the portfolio repository! This is a curated collection of 'learning' and 'how-to' Visual Studio IDE projects designed to demonstrate various programming concepts, techniques, and best practices.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to house multiple projects while demonstrating advanced Git concepts, particularly Git submodules for managing independent project repositories within a top-level portfolio.

## Project Categories

### 1. Learning Projects (`learning-projects/`)
Educational projects designed to teach specific programming concepts, frameworks, or technologies. These projects include detailed documentation and step-by-step tutorials.

### 2. Starter Projects (`starter-projects/`)
Ready-to-use project templates that provide a solid foundation for starting new applications. These include common configurations, folder structures, and basic implementations.

### 3. Conceptual Projects (`conceptual-projects/`)
Projects that demonstrate specific programming concepts, design patterns, algorithms, or architectural approaches.

## Working with Git Submodules

This repository uses Git submodules to manage multiple independent projects. Each project can be maintained in its own repository while being accessible from this portfolio.

### Quick Start with Submodules

```bash
# Clone this repository with all submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/roughcutsoftware/portfolio.git

# If you already cloned without --recursive, initialize submodules
git submodule init
git submodule update

# Update all submodules to their latest commits
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

For more advanced Git concepts and commands, see [GIT_GUIDE.md](GIT_GUIDE.md).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/roughcutsoftware/portfolio.git
   cd portfolio
   ```

2. **Explore projects:**
   Each project directory contains its own README with specific instructions.

3. **Open in Visual Studio:**
   Navigate to any project directory and open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio IDE.
