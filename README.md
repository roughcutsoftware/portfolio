# Portfolio

This is a portfolio repo that will house multiple 'learning' and 'how-to' Visual Studio IDE projects.

## Initial Repo Requirements

- Working with multiple repos within a top-level repo, not necessarily a 'mono-repo', but using submodules
- Advanced Git concepts, along with git command examples
- Useful starter and conceptual projects

## Projects Included

- **Learn.MDE.MVC.Dtos**: Shared DTOs for learning and demo purposes
- **Learn.MDE.MVC.Api**: Example .NET 7 Web API project
- **Learn.MDE.MVC.Web**: Razor Pages web project for hands-on learning

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/roughcutsoftware/portfolio.git
   ```

2. Initialize and update submodules (if any):

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022 or later.

## Git Concepts

- Branching, rebasing, submodules, cherry-pick, stash, and more
- See `/docs` or project markdown files for hands-on examples

## Notes

- This workspace is intended for experimentation, learning, and interview preparation.
- Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
