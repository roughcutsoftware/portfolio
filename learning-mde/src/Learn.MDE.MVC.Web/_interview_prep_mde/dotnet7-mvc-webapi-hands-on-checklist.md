# Demonstrating Hands-on Experience: C# .NET 7, .NET MVC, .NET Web API

To demonstrate "Hands-on experience in developing applications using C# .NET 7, .NET MVC, .NET Web API," you should be able to:

1. **Project Setup & Structure**
   - Create and configure .NET 7 projects (MVC, Web API).
   - Understand project files, dependencies, and solution structure.

2. **C# Language Proficiency**
   - Use modern C# features (records, pattern matching, async/await, LINQ).
   - Write clean, maintainable, and testable code.

3. **.NET MVC**
   - Build controllers, views, and models.
   - Implement routing, model binding, and validation.
   - Use Razor syntax for dynamic views.
   - Apply dependency injection and middleware.
   - **Model Binding:**
     - Understand how MVC automatically maps HTTP request data (form fields, query strings, route data, JSON) to action method parameters and model objects.
     - Use attributes like `[FromBody]`, `[FromQuery]`, `[FromRoute]`, `[FromForm]`, and `[Bind]` to control binding behavior.
     - Handle validation using data annotations and `ModelState`.
     - Secure model binding to prevent over-posting attacks (e.g., using view models or the `[Bind]` attribute).

4. **.NET Web API**
   - Create RESTful endpoints using controllers.
   - Handle HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
   - Serialize/deserialize JSON with System.Text.Json or Newtonsoft.Json.
   - Implement authentication/authorization (JWT, cookies, etc.).
   - Use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation.

5. **Data Access**
   - Integrate Entity Framework Core for database operations.
   - Use migrations, DbContext, and LINQ queries.

6. **Testing**
   - Write unit and integration tests (NUnit, xUnit, Moq).

7. **Deployment & Configuration**
   - Configure appsettings.json, environment variables.
   - Deploy to IIS, Azure, or Docker.

8. **Troubleshooting & Debugging**
   - Use logging (ILogger), handle exceptions, and debug with Visual Studio.

9. **Version Control**
   - Use Git for source control and collaboration.

**Model Binding Note:**
Model binding is a core part of both MVC and Web API. You should be able to explain and demonstrate how data from HTTP requests is mapped to C# objects, how to customize this process, and how to validate and secure incoming data.

**Tip:** Be ready to show code samples, explain design decisions, and discuss real-world scenarios where you applied these skills.
