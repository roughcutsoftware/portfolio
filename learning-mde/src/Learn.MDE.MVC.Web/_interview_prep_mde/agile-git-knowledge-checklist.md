# Demonstrating Agile Process & Advanced Git Knowledge

To demonstrate "Good knowledge of agile process & Advanced Git knowledge (branches, submodules, rebasing)", you should be able to:

1. **Agile Process**
   - Understand Scrum/Kanban frameworks (sprints, standups, retrospectives, boards).
   - Write and manage user stories, tasks, and acceptance criteria.
   - Participate in sprint planning, reviews, and backlog grooming.
   - Use tools like Jira, Azure DevOps, or Trello for tracking.
   - Practice continuous integration, delivery, and feedback.

2. **Advanced Git Knowledge**
   - Create, merge, and manage branches (feature, release, hotfix).
   - Use rebase to maintain a clean commit history and resolve conflicts.
   - Work with submodules for managing dependencies or shared code.
   - Perform interactive rebasing (squash, edit, reorder commits).
   - Resolve merge conflicts and understand fast-forward vs. non-fast-forward merges.
   - Use Git hooks, stash, cherry-pick, and reflog for advanced workflows.
   - Collaborate using pull/merge requests and code reviews.

**Tip:** Be ready to explain real scenarios where you applied these skills, show command-line usage, and discuss best practices for team collaboration and code quality.
