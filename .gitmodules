# Git Submodules Configuration
#
# This file tracks all Git submodules in this repository.
# Each project is maintained as a separate Git repository and included here as a submodule.
#
# To add a new submodule:
#   git submodule add <repository-url> <path>
#
# Example:
#   git submodule add https://github.com/username/my-project.git learning-projects/my-project
#
# After adding a submodule, commit this file and the new submodule directory:
#   git add .gitmodules <path-to-submodule>
#   git commit -m "Add my-project as submodule"
#
# For more information, see GIT_GUIDE.md

# Example submodule entries (uncomment and modify when adding real projects):
#
# [submodule "learning-projects/csharp-basics"]
#     path = learning-projects/csharp-basics
#     url = https://github.com/roughcutsoftware/csharp-basics.git
#     branch = main
#
# [submodule "starter-projects/aspnet-core-api"]
#     path = starter-projects/aspnet-core-api
#     url = https://github.com/roughcutsoftware/aspnet-core-api-starter.git
#     branch = main
#
# [submodule "conceptual-projects/design-patterns"]
#     path = conceptual-projects/design-patterns
#     url = https://github.com/roughcutsoftware/design-patterns-demo.git
#     branch = main
